Let's figure out current trends! For example, in this notebook, following questions are analized:

Which show is more common in this Netflix dataset, movie or TV show? What is the most frequent word in the datasets's show titles? Which country produces most titles? How long is a typical movie? Which show genre is the most frequently ocurring in Netflix?

Methodology
The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. I create a minimum of one scatter plot, one histogram, one box plot and one bar graph with matplotlib, seaborn and worldcloud.
